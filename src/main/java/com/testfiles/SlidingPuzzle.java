On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5,
and an empty square represented by 0.
A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.
The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].
Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the
state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved,
 return -1.
 Examples:

Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
Output: 14

Algorithm:

Consider each state in the board as a graph node, we just need to find out
the min distance between start node and final target node "123450".
Since it's a single point to single point questions, Dijkstra is not
needed here. We can simply use BFS, and also count the level we passed.
Every time we swap 0 position in the String to find the next state.
Use a hashTable to store the visited states.
